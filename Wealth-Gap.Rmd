## Homeownership Rates by Racial Category

Here's a report about homeownership trends over time for different racial groups.

Each collaborator should make a different change -- make a line plot, add color, or hide the code.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
home_owner <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/home_owner.csv')

# Load library

# Your code here
library(ggplot2)
# Make a line plot of the percentage of homeowners for racial categories over time
# and color the plot by racial category

# Your code here
ggplot(data = home_owner) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = home_owner_pct, color = race))
```
